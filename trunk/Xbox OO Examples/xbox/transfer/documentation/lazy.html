<h1>Lazy Loading</h1>
<p>
	If the attribute of 'lazy' is set one  a 'manytoone', 'onetomany' or 'manytomany' element, the items that are stored in
	that composition are lazily loaded into the object.
</p>
<p>
	This means that when the object is first generated from the database, these records are not retrieved with the initial load.
</p>
<p>
	Only when a function that has been generated for the lazy composite element, such as 'get*Array()' or 'contains*()',  
	is called 
	that the required information is retrieved from the database, and the resulting object(s) are loaded.
