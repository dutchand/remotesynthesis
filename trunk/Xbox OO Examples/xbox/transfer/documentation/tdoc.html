<h1>TransferDoc</h1>
<p>
	TransferDoc is a utility to document specific TransferObject configurations within your application,
	without forcing you to reread the <a href="methods.html">Generated Methods</a> documentation repeatedly.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
	To install transfer doc, download it from the <a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/?action=transfer.download">downloads page</a>, and unzip it into
	the direcory of the application that is utilising Transfer.
</p>
<h2>Create the TransferFactory</h2>
<p>
	Opening the page for TransferDoc, to use the application to generate documentation, you will first need to 
	Fill in the form above the '(Re)Create the TransferFactory' to pass in relative paths to the appropriate XML files, and 
	definitions folder.
</p>
<p>
	This will probably be the same as the code used to initialise the TransferFactory in your application.
</p>
<p>
	Once the TransferFactory has been initialised, the line 'TransferFactory has been initialised' will display, and link to the
	Transfer configuration file will display.
</p>
<h2>Generate Documentation</h2>
<p>
	To generate documentation, select the class that you wish to generate documentation for in the box next to the label 'Transfer Class', and 
	click the 'Generate Documentation' button.
</p>
<p>
	The documentation will now display on the page.
</p>
<h2>Generated Documentation</h2>
<p>
	Here you will find the list of documentation that has already been created.
</p>
<p>
	Clicking on the link to the document will open the document in the page.
</p>
<p>
	Clicking 'refresh' will reload the TransferObject and recreate the documentation.
</p>
<p>
	Clicking 'delete' will delete the documentation.
</p>
<p>
	Clicking 'FlashPaper' will open the documentation directly from the FlashPaper SWF.
</p>
