<h1>Using Clone()</h1>
<p>
	You are able to make a deep clone of every generated TransferObject, by calling 'clone()' on it.
</p>
<p>
	This cloned object is outside of any caching that is currently in use within Transfer, which means
	that any changes that are done to this object, and are not saved, are only particlur to the request
	that they are currently in.
</p>
<p>
	It should be noted that Transfer.save() and transfer.update() on a clone object will update the object currently in cache to the state of the saved object
</p>
<h2>Caveat on cloned objects</h2>
<p>
	Cloned objects should not be added as compsites to objects that are not clones.  This can cause indeterminate results.
