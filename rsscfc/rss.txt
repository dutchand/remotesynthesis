      <link>http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/5/15/100-ColdFusion-OpenSource-Projects</link>
      <description>So the ColdFusion Open-Source List hit a milestone of sorts the other day when I added the 100th project to the list. While the milestone is somewhat arbitrary since I don&apos;t list every project by excercising a very limited set of editorial control (a...</description>

      <description>So in my recent exploits toying with javaLoader.cfc and a java library for parsing rss, I came upon some odd errors. Well, I am certainly a noob when it comes to Java, but it appears that when you call a method in java and that method returns a null,...</description>

      <description>So if you have followed any of my music related posts, you may be wondering if I like anything other than &quot;Retro-Electro-Rocktronica&quot; (ok, I made that genre up but I think it works). Well, in fact, I do, and this week&apos;s pick is a Latin album from Mex...
